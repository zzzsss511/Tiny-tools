# Tiny-tools
During daily coding, I meet some tiny challenges quite often, and I usually spend several hours on them, such as extracting the year from un-standard datetime format, drawing segmented bar graph et al. Here I'd like to make them to ready-to-use functions which will help me save a lot time in the future. I hope that they can also be helpful for you. I am more than happy to take any inputs.
